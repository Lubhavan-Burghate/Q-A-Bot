This project is a generative AI application designed to facilitate interactive question-answer sessions. Users select a topic, prompting the AI to generate a question using generative AI technology, such as Google's Generative AI (Gemini). Upon receiving the question, users provide an answer. The application then utilizes the same generative AI technology to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of the user's response, comparing it to model answers. This process ensures the correctness and relevance of the user's input in relation to the original question.
